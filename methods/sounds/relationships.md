## Relationships

This model uses two sounds to heuristicaly identify the relationships between two or more models. 

The two sonifications need to be time aligned, but this can be slightly out. 

### Method

* Take a sonification of data. I used a sonification of the Bluetooth identifers in a particular location. 

* Take an audio recording or second sonification from the same time. This came from an audio file made at that time. 

* Save both as a common form or identify a computational process to do align the sounds.

* In output.wav, I merged the files using Garageband as both were created as wav files. 
This could conceivably be done in software if merging to sonification or data streams. 

* Play the file. 

### Results

The process produces a file that can be heard. I focussed on the representations of the sonifcation along with the automotive noise and use it to interpret the data. 

One of the things that we might have silences in the data. As I recorded the audio, I am aware that it is missing the signals from the Bluetooth enabled device to the car. This appears to be broadcast over a different signal type that we do not listen to in the application.

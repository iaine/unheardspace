## App Supported Data Walk

We use the data walk protocol developed by Adam Greenfield, Alison Powell, and others. 

In this walk, the app is a digital participant. 

*  Decide the Map Route

*  Start the app

*  Walk the route and make notes

*  At the walk end, stop the app. 

*  Extract the data from the app and process.
